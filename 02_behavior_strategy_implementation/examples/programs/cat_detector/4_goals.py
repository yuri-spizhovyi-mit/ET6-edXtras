"""
A user can input anything, if the input is "yes" the program is excited
- given the user interrupts (Ctrl+C), the program is sad
- given the user inputs 'yes' (case insensitive) the program is excited
- given any other inputs, the program says it's "baaaaad"

Test cases:
- the user interrupts
  KeyboardInterrupt -> ':('
- any sort of 'yes'
  'yes' -> 'yes!'
  'Yes' -> 'Yes!'
  'yES' -> 'yES!'
- any other input
  'hello' -> 'baaaaad: hello'
  '' -> 'baaaaad: '
  'good bye' -> 'baaaaad: good bye'
