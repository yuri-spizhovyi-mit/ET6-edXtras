"""Generates a list with the integers from 0 -> n, in order.

Arguments: n, integer - the highest number in the list. defaults to 0.

Returns: list - all the integers from 0 -> n in order.

Raises:
    AssertionError if the argument is not an integer
    AssertionError if the argument is less than 0

Examples:

>>> list_up_to(0)
[0]

>>> list_up_to(3)
[0, 1, 2, 3]

>>> list_up_to(7)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
